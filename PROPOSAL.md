# CompArch Final Project Proposal

**Project title:** RISC-V for CompArch 2017

**Team Members:** Ian Hill

## Description

> RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is a new instruction set architecture (ISA) that was originally designed to support computer architecture research and education and is now set to become a standard open architecture for industry implementations under the governance of the RISC-V Foundation. The RISC-V ISA was originally developed in the Computer Science Division of the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley. -- *riscv.org*

In this project, I'll develop a complete classroom experience for introducing the RISC-V ISA to students of Olin College CompArch Fall 2017 and determine if it would be appropriate for future CompArch classes to teach the RISC-V ISA instead of the MIPS ISA.

As part of this process, I'll thoroughly study the specification, design decisions, and current uses in order to create a slide deck and lecture notes for the classroom experience.

In the process of creating the classroom experience, it should become clear whether it would be appropriate and beneficial for future iterations of CompArch to use the RISC-V ISA instead of the MIPS ISA. Part of the project will be to articulate why or why not that switch

## Deliverables

- Slide deck
- Lecture notes
- MIPS vs RISC-V evaluation

## Work Plan

The lecture notes should be completed by the mid-point check in.

- Lecture notes (12 hours)
  - Reading the entire RISC-V spec (5 hours)
  - Outline the notes (0.5 hours)
  - Write the notes (6.5 hours)
- Slide deck and other classroom activities (10 hours)
  - Outline the slide deck (0.5 hours)
  - Create the slide deck and activities (9.5 hours)
- MIPS vs RISC-V evaluation (2 hours)
